                    <p>Game development engine Unity has announced on its official blog that the latest version has been released and that it now includes native support for the Nintendo Switch. The latest version of the engine brings it to version 5.6. There’s a number of Unity games on Switch available and also coming soon including Super Bomberman R and Yooka-Laylee.</p>

                        <p><em>“With the option to play docked console-style or handheld on-the-go, the Nintendo Switch offers a new opportunity for creators to think a bit differently about their games. Several Unity titles like Super Bomberman and Snipperclips presented at GDC on Unity booth have been released already. We are happy to announce that support for Nintendo Switch is now available (note that current support is based on Unity 5.5, Unity 5.6 support will be available during the 5.6.x cycle).”</em></p>

                    <p>Every Wednesday, Media Create publish sales figures which show how well software and hardware are performing in Japan. This week the Nintendo Switch was, once again, the best-selling hardware in the land of the rising sun. However, what is interesting is that early sales of the console are outpacing the PlayStation 4 in the same time period. Nintendo’s latest console has hit 500K sales already despite there being shortages.</p>

                  <h3>Joy-Con controller Repairs</h3>
                    
                    <p>Do you see what it is? Nintendo have a solution for the Switch's Joy-Con de-dyncing issues, and it's just that tiny bit of foam. Those in the know suspect that the foam is actually conductive foam, which is foam that's been specially treated with nickel, copper or both so it can shield electronics from RF interference. Seems like it's doing the job!</p>

                    <p>Also worth noting, some people are purchasing Joy-Cons from Amazon right now that don't seem to have the issue. When opened up, they don't have the foam inside, but they do have a different codes on the circuit board. Whether than mean Nintendo has already changed the manufacturing process or it's not related is unknown.</p>

                  <h3>What To Do When You Can't Afford A Nintendo Switch</h3>
                    
                    <p>A fifth-grader in Japan crafted a Switch out of cardboard, complete with inter-changeable accessories, after his mum wouldn’t buy him the real thing. Twitter user @fraise_ama, the young boy’s older sister, shared a video clip of his masterpiece, whilst also sharing that her little brother dreams of being a video game creator one day.</p>
